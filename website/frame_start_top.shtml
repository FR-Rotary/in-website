<p><a name="start"></a>Welcome to the network resource server at Rotary and Vattentornet. 
  The initial purpose of this server, &quot;IN-maskinen&quot;, was to let people 
  on this network gain access to their computers fom the outside, i.e. set up 
  personal ftp/www servers. After the switch to public IP-numbers that is no longer 
  necessary, the focus now is primarily to offer web-hosting, unix shell accounts 
  and variuos server functions. <br>
  Everyone at Rotary and Vattentornet with an SGS internet connection can apply 
  for an account</p>
</font> 
<p><font face="helvetica, arial">If you have any suggestions of server functions/services 
  that you think should be implemented, send an email to <a href="mailto:it@fr-rotary.com">IT responsible at FR</a>. 
  Please feel free to donate equipment to IN-maskinen. All contributors will be 
  given <a href="info/teknisk_info.html#acknowledgements" target="display">credit</a> 
  on the hompage.</font>
